### [linear-quadratic](linear-quadratic/)

Examples in this folder are **linear-quadratic dynamic optimization** (LQDO) problems that can be solved using quadratic programming.
Solving problems in this class was the original use case of DTQP.

##### Some Key Examples
- [bryson-denham](linear-quadratic/bryson-denham/)
- [bryson-ho-166](linear-quadratic/bryson-ho-166)
- [dt-qp-1](linear-quadratic/dt-qp-1)
- [lqr-standard](linear-quadratic/lqr-standard)

### [nonlin](nonlin/)

Examples in this folder are **nonlinear dynamic optimization** (NLDO) problems that can be solved using nonlinear programming.

##### Some Key Examples
- [brachistochrone](nonlin/brachistochrone/)
- [simple-suspension](nonlin/simple-suspension/)
- [transfer-min-fuel](nonlin/transfer-min-fuel/)
- [tuberculosis](nonlin/tuberculosis/)
